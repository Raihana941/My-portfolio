            <strong> Introduction</strong><br />
            Hi, I'm Raihana Mawlawizadeh, a recent high school graduate from
            Afghan-Turk Maarif Schools. With a deep sense of curiosity and a
            drive to grow, I'm excited to shape a future full of learning,
            creativity, and impact.

            <strong>Academic Background<br /></strong>I completed my high school
            education with dedication. My academic journey was filled with
            achievements, but more importantly, it taught me the value of
            discipline, determination, and the joy of learning.

            <strong>My Journey in Coding<br /></strong>As a junior in the world
            of programming, I'm currently learning web design and discovering
            the beauty of combining logic with creativity. While I'm still at
            the beginning of this journey, I'm committed to building strong
            foundational skills in HTML and CSS, and slowly expanding into
            JavaScript and beyond. Every project I take on helps me adapt more
            confidently to this exciting digital environment.

            <strong>Personal Philosophy<br /></strong> I'm a passionate student
            who truly believes in the power of hard work, consistency, and
            learning with purpose. I believe that even small steps, taken with
            heart, lead to meaningful growth. My approach to every challenge is
            simple: stay curious, stay kind, and never stop evolving.
